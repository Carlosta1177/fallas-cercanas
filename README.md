Project Report: FALL-ASS Application
https://fall-ass.streamlit.app/
1. Introduction
The FALL-ASS application, a user-friendly web-based tool developed using Streamlit, is designed to enhance the experience of visitors and residents in Valencia during the Fallas. Leveraging various geolocation and routing services, the application provides users with detailed information and personalized recommendations about the nearest fallas (traditional Valencian monuments), including adult fallas, children's fallas, and fallas tents (carpas falleras). The project's goal is to ensure that users can efficiently plan their visits and enjoy the festival to the fullest, all with the convenience of a single application.
2. Application Overview
The FALL-ASS application offers two primary functionalities, which you can choose through the sidebar:
Find the Nearest Falla
If you simply want to visit the nearest falla, this is your option. Enter your location along with optional filters (such as the type of falla or its category), and you will get the nearest falla to your location, along with relevant information such as the year of foundation, the motto, the logo, etc. Additionally, an interactive map will show the route from your location to the resulting falla. An example is shown with a random location in the center of Valencia, with the filter of adult fallas and special category, where we can see all the information of the nearest falla and the interactive map.


Calculate a Tourist Route:
This option will be very useful if you want to spend some time viewing different fallas. It allows you to visualize a route of fallas (with optional filters such as the category of the falla like in the previous option) within a maximum distance that you select. By entering your location and other parameters, you will get a list of fallas to visit and an interactive map showing the path you should take. Another example is now shown with the same location as before and the same filters, and where we obtain a list of faults that make up the tourist route, along with the interactive map.

3. Benefits of the Application
The FALL-ASS application offers several benefits. It enhances navigation by helping users efficiently locate and visit fallas, thereby reducing the time spent searching for these monuments. It also provides a personalized experience, allowing users to customize their exploration based on their location and preferences. This application encourages deeper engagement with the Fallas festival by making discovering and learning about different fallas easier, thus fostering cultural engagement. Moreover, it supports local tourism by providing a tool that enhances the visitor experience during one of Valencia's most significant cultural events.
